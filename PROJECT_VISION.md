# API Guard

## Problem
Startups need to protect and monitor their APIs without building complex
rate limiting, monitoring, and abuse-prevention infrastructure.

## Target Users
- Backend engineers
- Startups with 1–10 production APIs
- Teams without dedicated DevOps

## Core Value
- Drop-in API gateway
- Distributed rate limiting
- Real-time visibility into API health

## Non-Goals (v1)
- No Kubernetes
- No ML-based anomaly detection
- No multi-region support

## Success Criteria
- Correct rate limiting under concurrency
- Predictable performance
- Secure by default
